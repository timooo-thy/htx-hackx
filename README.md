- **🤖Automated Training Pipeline**  
  Our platform includes a fully automated pipeline for computer vision (CV) model training, covering all stages from segmentation, labeling, and training to deployment.

- **🧠Comprehensive Admin Capabilities**  
  The admin dashboard offers a detailed view of emergency calls, officer deployment, open cases, and overall incident statistics. The data visualization is interactive, allowing for quick insights into real-time events and recent activities.

- **🗺️Live Patrol Map**  
  A live patrol map simulates the real-time locations of officers and displays active incident locations, giving admins a clear operational overview.

- **🏋️Streamlined Training Workflow**  
  Quickly train CV models through an intuitive process. Choose segments, provide descriptions, and start the training process with a single click. The platform uses transfer learning to significantly reduce training time while maintaining high accuracy by freezing pre-trained layers and training only the final layer.
